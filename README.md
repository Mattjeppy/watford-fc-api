## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript

Makes use of api for football api-football.com

- response caching
Store results in your own backend for 5–15 minutes (or longer for static data like squads).

- scheduled background updates
Run a cron job every hour to fetch fresh data instead of hitting the API on every user request.

- endpoint consolidation
Fetch multiple pieces of data in a single API call when possible.

- local database storage
Save fixtures, players, and league tables so you only refresh when needed.
